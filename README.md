## üìÉ Usage

### üîπ Command-Line Help

```text
usage: MinecraftModPackDownloader [-h] [--curseforge | --modrinth] file

Download mods for a Minecraft modpack.

Positional arguments:
  file          Path to .zip / .mrpack file

Options:
  -h, --help    Show this help message and exit
  --curseforge  Download mods from CurseForge
  --modrinth    Download mods from Modrinth
```

### üîπ Example Usage

```bash
# Download mods for a CurseForge modpack
MinecraftModPackDownloader "Modpack.zip" --curseforge

# Download mods for a Modrinth modpack
MinecraftModPackDownloader "Modpack.mrpack" --modrinth
```

The mods will be downloaded to the directory: `{Modpack_Name}/overrides/mods`

If the modpack includes resource packs or shaders:

- **Modrinth**: These will automatically be separated into the appropriate folders: `resourcepacks` and `shaders`.
- **CurseForge**: All files will be downloaded into the `mods` folder. You will need to manually check for resource packs or shaders and move them to their respective folders (`resourcepacks` and `shaders`).
